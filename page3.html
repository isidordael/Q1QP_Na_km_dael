        The shape of the histogram of the Retail Album sale is skewed to 
        the right meaning it's positively skewed. This means that the majority 
        of data are on the left side of the graph because a large number of 
        occurrences are on the left side of the graph and few are on the right 
        side of the graph.

        The group category is composed of 4 different categories. Girl Group, 
        Boy Group, Solo, and the Entertainment Artists. This shows what category 
        the idol/group is in.

        The type of album in our data set is composed of 12 different categories. 
        Extended Play, Studio Album, Mini Album, Single Album, Repackage Album, 
        Weverse Album, Special Extended Play, Debut Extended Play, Compilation 
        Album, Debut Studio Album, Winter Album, and Trot Album. These categories 
        tell us what type of album was released.
    </p>
    <h1 class="data" id="Conc">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Our data set is a sample of the best-selling K-pop retail albums In 2022. 
    In our data set, we had 50 samples of the entire population of the best-selling 
    pop albums in 2022. The interesting fact about our report is that out of the 
    50 albums, 21 girl groups had the most albums sold in the K-pop industry. 
    Which makes this the majority of the 4 different group categories combined.
The results also tell us what the people prefer now. Since the majority of the 
sales are coming from Girl Groups, we can say that today is now the “Girl Group 
Age”. They captured the hearts of the people, which led them to be very profitable
 because they were in demand compared to the other group categories.
There are also problems that might come up in the future and these problems 
could be our database based on opinions, miscalculations, and theories with no 
official claims at all. It could be the website that we got our information from
 may come out not being that accurate because there are other sources that have 
 different values (by points). To fix these problems, we believe that finding a 
 reliable and updated source would solve these two. Always check the reliability 
 of the source and try to look for other sources to confirm the reliability and 
 accuracy of your main source.</p>hakdog
